Extracted the files
	- BETRIEB_DE
	- BFKOORD_WGS
	- BITFELD
	- FPLAN

Modifications:
	- FPLAN is reduced to the first two public transport lines (Brienz BRB to Rothorn via Planalp and back).
	- BETRIEB_DE and BFKOORD_WGS are reduced to only the values required by the reduced FPLAN.
	- BITFELD is also reduced to the line required by the reduced FPLAN, but additionally the BITFELD-Stream of this line was changed and simplified for testing purposes.
