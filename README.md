# PT2MATSim

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/matsim-org/pt2matsim.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/matsim-org/pt2matsim)

PT2MATSim is a package to convert schedule data such as GTFS, HAFAS or OSM to a completely mapped MATSim schedule.

There are multiple public transit schedule data formats, widely used formats are GTFS and HAFAS. Numerous GTFS feeds are
publicly available (see [transitfeeds.com](https://transitfeeds.com) or [transit.land](http://www.transit.land)), otherwise these files
have to be obtained from the public transit agency. The Swiss public transit schedule is available GTFS and HAFAS format via [opentransportdata.swiss](https://opentransportdata.swiss).
Public transit data feeds can be converted to unmapped MATSim transit schedules using the classes _Gtfs2Transitschedule_ or _Hafas2TransitSchedule_.
It is possible to convert public transit information from OpenStreetMap files (_Osm2TransitSchedule_). However,
OSM currently does not contain any temporal information, the accuracy of the schedule data varies and is
usually not sufficient to be used for simulations.

Unmapped MATSim transit schedule lack information on the links used by vehicles and only contain the stop sequence
for transit routes. Generating these links (i.e. the path a vehicle takes on a network) is called "mapping", a process
done by the _PublicTransitMapper_. It implements an algorithm that uses an abstract graph to calculate the least cost path
from the transit route's first to its last stop with the constraint that the path must contain a so called link candidate
for every stop. The result is a mapped transit schedule and a modified network.

Tools to validate and rudimentarily edit the mapped schedule are also part of the package.

## Creating a multimodal network

The converter is based on the OSM network by M. Rieser (_org.matsim.core.utils.io.OsmNetworkReader_). However, some changes
have been made: The default values for links as well as parameters are stored in a _config.xml_ file. This file allows to
define whether an opposite link should be created and to set values for capacity, freespeed and the number of lanes
for _highway=*_ and _railway=*_ tags. This also allows to convert rail links. In addition, ways that are only used by
buses (i.e. are part of a relation tagged with _route=*_ in OSM) are included in a network. If information on number of lanes 
or freespeed is available for an OSM way, it is used for the MATSim link. Relevant OSM attributes (for ways and routes) are
stored as link attributes in the network.

It is recommended to simplify the network by inserting only one link instead of multiple links between two intersections. 
The Euclidian distance between the new link's end nodes will less than the the summed up length of the replaced links but 
the original length can be stored in the length attribute of the new link.

A default config file can be created by running

    org.matsim.pt2matsim.run.CreateDefaultOsmConfig defaultConfigFile.xml
    
The converter can be run via

    org.matsim.pt2matsim.run.Osm2MultimodalNetwork
    
with the config file path as argument.   

## Creating an unmapped MATSim transit schedule

### From GTFS

The GTFS converter's main job is transforming GTFS trips to MATSim transit routes. Trips and transit routes are not
equivalent: A trip defines the stop sequence and the departure time for a vehicle while a MATSim transit route defines
the stop sequence but usually has more than one departure time. The time offsets between stops is stored in the
routeProfile within the transit route in MATSim. GTFS offers two ways: Either with explicit time stamps in
stop_times.txt or as frequencies in frequencies.txt. The converter can use both. Finally, routes in GTFS are like
transit lines in MATSim. Stops are converted straight to stop facilities. GTFS offers no explicit information that could
be used as isBlocking value for MATSim stop facilities, so false is set by default.

For each trip, a service id defines on which days the trip is carried out. MATSim normally only simulates one day,
therefore one sample day has to be extracted from the GTFS feed. Although possible, it is not recommended to use
all trips in the feed. The following methods are suggested:

- Define the date to extract all affected trips from it.
- Use the day on which most services run.
- Use the day on which most trips are carried out.

The converter can be run by calling the main() method of

    org.matsim.pt2matsim.run.Gtfs2TransitSchedule

with the following arguments:

    [0] folder where the gtfs files are located (a single zip file is not supported)
    [1] Which service ids should be used. One of the following:
    	- date in the format "yyyymmdd"
    	- "dayWithMostServices"
    	- "dayWithMostTrips"
    	- "all"
    [2] the output coordinate system. Use "WGS84" for no transformation. EPSG:* codes are supported.
    [3] output transit schedule file
    [4] output default vehicles file (optional)

If a feed contains shapes, the shape id is stored in the transit route's description.

### From HAFAS
HAFAS is a data format used by Swiss public transit agencies (particularly SBB) and other agencies in Europe (e.g. Deutsche Bahn).
Data is given in ASCII text files that contain information about operators, stops, vehicles and stop sequences, stop times and
additional information. HAFAS data for Switzerland is publicly available and provided by SBB. A report that
comes with this exported data provides information on the structure of the files.

Stop facilities are created from the stops defined in the file BFKOORD_GEO (uses WGS84). The transit lines, routes, departures and stop sequences
are generated from _FPLAN_. The file _BETRIEB_DE_ is used to add the agency's name to the transit line id. The reference day is
extracted using _BITFELD_. A default transport mode is assigned to each transit route depending on the vehicle defined in
HAFAS. The transport modes correspond to one of the eight transport modes defined in GTFS (see [GTFS reference](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/routes-file)).
Optionally, a default vehicle file is provided using predefined values (based on data provided by M. Rieser and P. BÃ¶sch) for different vehicle types 
such as interregional trains, S-Bahn trains or trolley buses.

Converts all files in _hafasFolder_ and writes the output schedule and vehicle file. Stop Facility coordinates are transformed to _outputCoordinateSystem_.

The converter can be run by calling the main() method of

    org.matsim.pt2matsim.run.Hafas2TransitSchedule

with the following arguments:

    [0] hafasFolder
    [1] outputCoordinateSystem. Use "WGS84" for no transformation. EPSG:* codes are supported.
    [2] outputScheduleFile
    [3] outputVehicleFile

### From OSM

OSM offers tags to specify spatial public transit data on stop locations and transit routes. The converter provided as 
part of the package creates an unmapped transit schedule from OSM data. It creates stop facilities from OSM nodes with
the tag _public\_transport=stop\_position_. Relations with the tag _route=*_ are converted to transit routes. These transit 
routes contain only stop sequences. Link sequences are not converted even if they are available. The transport mode is set 
based on the respective _route=*_ tag value of the relation.

The quality of the generated transit schedule for a region depends largely on the accuracy of the data in OSM. Often
route data is either inconsistent or not even available. The lack of naming conventions further complicates using the data. 
In addition, OSM does not offer any tags to store temporal information. Thus, departure times and stop offsets have to be
gathered from other sources.

The converter can be run via

    org.matsim.pt2matsim.run.Osm2TransitSchedule
    
with the following arguments    

    [0] osm file
	[1] output schedule file
	[2] output coordinate system (optional)
    
## Mapping a transit schedule to a network

### Public Transit Mapper

All input parameters are defined in a config file, a default config file can be created via
    
    org.matsim.pt2matsim.run.CreateDefaultPTMapperConfig
    
The whole schedule is mapped to the network. In cases where only subsets should be used (e.g. for a region), 
the schedule needs to be filtered beforehand.

The Public Transit Mapper is run via

    org.matsim.pt2matsim.run.PublicTransitMapper

with a config file as input argument.

### Algorithm Overview
A reference link for each stop and the path between those referenced links have to be defined. To generate the paths,
the following input data is usually available for each transit route: stop sequence, stops with coordinates and a
network as a directed graph.

The algorithm works without using any additional GPS data. It is assumed that a public transit vehicle can access a
stop by passing a link which is referenced to the stop. Depending on the input data, stop locations are not available, i.e.
multiple stop locations on different roads are combined to one parent stop with the same name in the schedule. When two
lines use a stop at an intersection there might be one to four actual stop locations.

The implemented algorithm (called pseudo routing algorithm) looks at the whole route to define the best link for each
stop. It is also possible that more than one optimal link can be found for a stop. The algorithm calculates the least
cost path from the transit route's first to its last stop with the constraint that the path must contain a link candidate of
every stop. For each transit route, the algorithm consists of the following steps:

1. Find link candidates for each stop.
2. Create a pseudo graph using the link candidates as nodes. Add a dummy source and destination node to the pseudo graph.
3. Calculate the least cost path between each link candidate pair. This path is represented by an edge in the pseudo graph, connecting two link candidate nodes. The edge weight is the path's travel cost plus half the travel cost of the two link candidates it connects.
4. Calculate the pseudo least cost path from the source node to the destination node in the pseudo graph. The resulting least cost path contains the best link candidate for each stop.
5. Create the link sequence. Each stop is referenced to a link (given by the best link candidate that is part of the pseudo least cost path). The least cost path on the real network between the referenced links is used to create the network path for the transit route.

### Algorithm implementation and parameters

#### Link candidates
First, a set of link candidates is created for each stop facility and schedule transport mode. For nodes around the
stop coordinate, the in- and outlinks are fetched and sorted in ascending order by their distance from the stop facility.
All links within the "candidate distance" are considered as link candidates. The candidate distance is calculated by
multiplying the distance from stop facility to the n-th link (defined by _nLinkThreshold_) and the _candidateDistanceMultiplier_ factor.
For example, if the 6th link is located 12 meters from the stop facility, given a multiplier of 1.5, all links within 18 meters
from the stop facility are considered as link candidates. However, no links farther than _maxLinkCandidateDistance_ from the stop
facility are used. Stop facilities with no link within _maxLinkCandidateDistance_ are given a dummy loop link at their
coordinates: A node is added at the coordinate and a dummy loop link is added to the network with the added node as
source and destination. The loop link is referenced to the stop facility and is set as its only link candidate.
Note: If _maxLinkCandidateDistance_ is 0, all routes use artificial links. That way an separate network for public transit
can be created.

#### Creating mode dependent router
The config parameterset _transportModeAssignment_ defines for a transport mode, what links a transit route is allowed
to use. For example, transit routes with schedule mode bus can only use links with "bus" or "car" as modes. Similarly, all 
transit routes with the transport mode rail can only use rail links. If no assignment for a schedule transport mode is given, 
all transit routes using that mode are mapped with artificial links between stops.

To calculate the least cost paths as part of pseudo routing, a router is needed for every transport mode. To create these routers, 
mode separated networks are generated. Then an A\* router for each of these networks is initialized. The networks are filtered 
according to the _transportModeAssignment_. The router uses one of two link travel costs: either _linkLength_ or _travelTime_,
defined in parameter _travelCostType_.

#### Pseudo graph and routing
During this step the best sequence of link candidates for each transit route is calculated. While routing on the network uses 
an A\* router, least cost path search on the pseudo graph is done with a separate Dijkstra implementation.

Artificial links connect the toNode of a link candidate with the fromNode of the next link candidate. Artificial links
are added to the network in two cases: When no path on the network between two link candidates can be found or if the least 
cost path has costs greater than a threshold. This threshold is defined as _maxTravelCostFactor_ times the minimal travel costs.
The minimal travel costs depend on the parameter _travelCostType_: If it is _linkLength_, the beeline distance between the two
stops is used. If it is _travelTime_, the minimal travel cost is equivalent to the travel time needed based on the arrival and
departure offsets of the two stops. All artificial links (including loop links for stop facilities) and nodes have the prefix "pt_".

The step "PseudoRouting" creates PseudoRoutes for each transit route, each of which contains a sequence of PseudoRouteStops.
A PseudoRouteStop contains information on the stop facility, the link candidate as well as departure and arrival offsets.

This pseudo routing step can be parallelized using multiple threads (_numOfThreads_). For each thread a queue of transit lines is
handled. However, the search for the shortest path between link candidates uses the routing algorithms provided in the MATSim core 
which are not thread safe. Access to the mode separated routers had to be synchronized.

Since the shortest paths on the network have been calculated, the optimal link sequence for each transit route is known.
After this step, all artificial links are added to the network.

#### Child stop facilities and route profiles
After all pseudoRoutes have been created, most likely there are multiple best links for a stop facility because different routes 
use different links. For each of these links a "child stop facility" is created. It has the same name and coordinate as its parent 
stop facility but it has a link referenced. The id of the child stop facility is generated by combining the parent stop id and the 
link id, connected by the string ".link:". For example the child stop facility of parent stop 64587 which is connected to the link 
432 would get the id "64587.link:432". Using the same connection string for all parts of the package allows to infer the parent 
stop id based on the given stop facility id.

Since it is now known which link candidates and thus child stop facility each transit route uses, route profiles (stop sequences)
for all transit routes can be created.

#### Cleaning schedule and network
Pseudo routing is finished after the previous steps. However, some artifacts remain in the schedule and the network. By default, 
stop facilities that are not used by any transit route are removed (_removeNotUsedStopFacilities_). The freespeed of artificial links is
set according to the schedule: For all transit routes the minimal necessary freespeed to ensure they are on schedule is calculated. The
highest minimal freespeed of all transit routes of a link is used as the link's freespeed. This process can be done for other link transport
modes as well (defined in _scheduleFreespeedModes_). It is recommended to do this for rail.

The transport mode of each transit route is assigned to its used links. Links that are not used by a transit route are 
removed. This can clean up and simplify rail networks. Links which have a mode defined in _modesToKeepOnCleanup_ are kept
regardless of public transit usage.

### Check Mapped Schedule Plausibility
While the TransitScheduleValidator is a good first indicator of the quality of a schedule, 
it does not check how plausible a transit route is. Possible implausibilities are for example if a 
route has loops, if sudden direction changes happen between links (u-turns) or if the travel times given 
by the schedule are cannot be met. If the travel time between two stops is higher than the scheduled time 
this points to either a too long (i.e. wrong) route or too low freespeed values on the network.

The package provides a plausibility check via 

    org.matsim.pt2matsim.run.CheckMappedSchedulePlausibility
    
that looks for implausible parts of a route and warns accordingly. It needs the input:
	
	[0] schedule file
	[1] network file
	[2] coordinate system (of both schedule and network)
	[3] output folder

The following files are created in the output folder:

- _allPlausibilityWarnings.csv_: shows all plausibility warnings in a csv file
- _stopfacilities.csv_: the number of child stop facilities for all stop facilities as csv
- _stopfacilities_histogram.png_: a histogram as png showing the number of child stop facilities
- _shp/warnings/WarningsLoops.shp_: Loops warnings as polyline shapefile
- _shp/warnings/WarningsTravelTime.shp_: Travel time warnings as polyline shapefile
- _shp/warnings/WarningsDirectionChange.shp_: Direction change warnings as polyline shapefile
- _shp/schedule/TransitRoutes.shp_: Transit routes of the schedule as polyline shapefile
- _shp/schedule/StopFacilities.shp_: Stop Facilities as point shapefile
- _shp/schedule/StopFacilities_refLinks.shp_: The stop facilities' reference links as polyline shapefile

Shapefiles can be viewed in a GIS, a recommended open source application is [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org). It is also possible to view them in [senozon via](https://via.senozon.com/). However, no line attributes can be displayed or viewed there.
